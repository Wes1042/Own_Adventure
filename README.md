# Own_Adventure
This is a repository for my MMP class. It is a basic assignment for front end-development. 

Create a “choose your own adventure” story with HTML and CSS  code. 

Each page should give the user 2 options to choose from. 
There should be a total of (at least) 5 HTML pages. 
All your pages should include the required tags (html, head, title, body). You should also use h1 (main header), p (paragraph), img (image) and a(link). 
Always include an option to go back to the home page (index.html). 
Make sure you only use Creative Commons or Public Domain images and that you attribute them directly on the page. 
Once you’ve completed and tested all the HTML, style your code with CSS. Use at least the following properties: color, text-size, font-family, text-decoration). 
Finally, upload the entire project on GitHub (follow these instructions).
